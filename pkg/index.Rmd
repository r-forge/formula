# Extended Formulas in R

Infrastructure for extended formulas in R with multiple parts on the
right-hand side and/or multiple responses on the left-hand side.

```{r}
## extended Formula with 2 right-hand sides for mtcars data
library("Formula")
F <- Formula(log(mpg) ~ disp | factor(vs))
mf <- model.frame(f, data = head(mtcars, 3))

## extract response and both regressor matrices from model frame
model.response(mf)
model.matrix(F, data = mf, rhs = 1)
model.matrix(F, data = mf, rhs = 2)
```
